### What is ANOVA 

ANOVA is a framework for analyzing main effects and interactions. 

ANOVA uses categorical predictors (factors) with multiple levels (groups) to test whether these factors jointly affect a conditional function of the response variable.

ANOVA uses: 
- An underlying regression model (linear, logistic, Cox, etc.) 
- A test statistic (F-statistic or χ² statistic) to assess factor impacts
